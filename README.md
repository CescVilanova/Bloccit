# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

The app name is: CescVilanova-Bloccit

The production url is: http://cescvilanova-bloccit.herokuapp.com/

## Setup
Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
